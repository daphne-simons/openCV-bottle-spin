# openCV-bottle-spinner

## My journey into learning how to work with webcams and control media content, e.g. video files and images, with openCV software and Python. 

### How to run files: 

- Single Bottle: `python ./spin-bottle.py`
- Multiple Bottles: `python ./spin-bottles.py`
- Video playback speed in relation to speed: `python ./vid-bottle.py`
